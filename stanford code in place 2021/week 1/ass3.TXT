Q3: Cleanup Karel, Milestone 1
Your next task is to execute a "safe pickup" -- Karel can pick up beepers, but not if none are present! Write a program which will check if a beeper is present at the position Karel is currently on and pick up a beeper if one is present (if there are no beepers present, Karel shouldn't do anything).

Two worlds are provided for you to test your code on -- on the world where Karel starts on a beeper, your code should get Karel to pick the beeper up. On the world where Karel starts on a blank spot, your code shouldn't do anything.

We've provided you two 1x1 worlds (one with a beeper, one without) on which to test your code. You can toggle from the beeper-present world to the no-beeper world by changing the very last line in the file from run_karel_program('SafePickup1.w') to run_karel_program('SafePickup2.w') (and vice versa).

For example, to use the SafePickup1.w world:


from karel.stanfordkarel import *

"""
File: SafePickup.py
--------------------
When you finish writing this file, Karel should be able to
pick up a beeper from the current position if one is present
(but do nothing if no beepers are present).
"""

def main():
    """
    You should write your code to make Karel do its task in
    this function. Make sure to delete the 'pass' line before
    starting to write your own code. You should also delete this
    comment and replace it with a better, more descriptive one.
    """
    if beepers_present():
        pick_beeper()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    run_karel_program('SafePickup1.w')
